Bitcoin is a crypto currency that is used allover the world for digital payments orsimply as an investment. 
Bitcoin is decentralized, which means that no oneowns it. 
Bitcoin transactions are simple because they are not tied to any country.Investing can be done through a variety of"bitcoin exchanges" or marketplaces. 
This enables people to sell and buy Bitcoins in avariety of currencies. Mt Gox is the largestBitcoin exchange. 
Bitcoins are kept in adigital wallet, which functions similarly to avirtual bank account. 
The record of alltransactions, as well as the timestampdata, is stored in a location known asBlockchain.

For this project we decided to use LSTMs.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence insequence prediction problems.
